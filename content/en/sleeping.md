Once you arrive at the refuge, introduce yourself at the reception. Then we'll show you your dormitory and you can choose the bed where you sleep.

Each bed is equipped with a duvet and coverage. Don't forget to bring a cloth sleeping bag. In case you forget, we have cloth sleeping bags for one time use available.
