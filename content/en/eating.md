Dear hikers, we offer all day long snacks and drinks to enjoy with a high mountain panoramic view. 

The dishes are created with organic, seasonal and local products. These are the three essential qualities on which base we compose each evening a tasty unique menu. 

Come and taste our simple and creative dishes made with love and the products of the surounding farms and our own garden.
